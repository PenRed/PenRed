# Quadric Examples: Blender & PenRed (Jupyter Notebooks)

This folder contains some examples of the penRed package, integrating Blender for geometry creation and simulation configuration, along with Jupyter Notebooks for simulation control and analysis.

## Prerequisites

- Blender 4.2.3 with the PenRed plug-in installed.
- pyPenRed.
- Jupyter Lab.


## Contents

Each example is in its own folder and contains:

- **Blender File (`*.blend`)**: The visual geometry and configuration parameters created in Blender 4.2.3. 

- **Jupyter Notebook (`*.ipynb`)**: The script to run and analyze the simulation.

## Usage

1.  **Export from Blender:** Use the export function in the PenRed plug-in to generate the required configuration and geometry files from the `.blend` file.
2.  **Run the Notebook:** The Jupyter Notebook will:
    - Describe the example.
    - Import the **PenRed** module.
    - **Execute** the simulation.
    - **Plot** the results using the different plotting options offered.
