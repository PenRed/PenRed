## Particle Sources

Any Blender object can be defined as a particle source, even if it is not a mesh object. To enable a particle source for an object, the **Source** flag must be enabled in the **Object > Source Properties**:

The source can be configured with several options, which are described in this section. The first two parameters to define are:


- **`Histories`**  
  Sets the number of histories to be simulated. In penRed, a history has the same meaning as in PENELOPE: it represents a primary particle generated by the source. For example, if the user sets one million histories for an electron source, one million electrons will be sampled by the source, according to the specified parameters, and simulated through the geometry system. Along with the primary particle, all descendant particles produced will also be simulated.

- **`Type`**  
  Specifies whether all sampled particles are of a specific type (e.g., Gammas, Electrons, or Positrons) or if a Phase Space File (PSF) will be used to read the particles states. A PSF includes the type, energy, position, and direction information for each particle to be simulated. This PSF files can be created using a [PSF tally](detector-tallies.md#psf).
  
### Single Particle Type Sampling

  If no PSF is used, the methods to sample the particle state must be specified. These include sampling its **energy**, **position**, **direction**, and **time** (if needed).
  
#### Energy

The plugin offers two methods to sample the initial particle energy, which can be selected using the **Type** parameter:

- **`Monoenergetic`**  
  All particles are set with the specified energy, in eV.

- **`Spectrum`**  
  The particle energy is randomly sampled following a spectrum defined in the specified file. This file must be accessible when the simulation is executed.  

  The format consists of a piecewise function where each entry in the spectrum contains two numbers:
  - The first number specifies the starting energy of a channel.
  - The second number specifies its unnormalized probability.  

  The probabilities must be non-negative and do not need to be normalized to unity. PenRed interprets a negative probability as the end of the spectrum. For example, a valid spectrum format is shown below, where the character `#` is interpreted as a comment. Note that the spectrum file must contain only comments or valid spectrum values until the end of the spectrum. Blank lines are not allowed, but all text beyond the end of the spectrum is ignored by the sampler.

```text
#Spectrum    (character '#' is interpreted as a comment)
1.20e3 10    1st channel: [1.20,1.61]keV
1.61e3 0.0   2nd channel: [1.61,5.00]keV, no emissions
5.00e3 20    monoenergetic line at 5.00 keV
5.00e3 0     3rd channel: [5.00,6.24]keV, no emissions
6.24e3 33.3  4th channel: [6.24,7.32]keV
7.32e3 5.02  5th channel: [7.32,8.00]keV
8.00e3 10.2  6th channel: [8.00,9.76]keV
9.76e3 15.2  7th channel: [9.76,10.0]keV
10.0e3 0.0   8th channel: [10.0,15.0]keV, no emissions
15.0e3 20    monoenergetic line at 15.0 keV
15.0e3 -1    end of the spectrum
```

#### Direction

Currently, the only direction sampling method consists of a *cone* following a specified direction vector. The parameters to define it are:

- **`Direction`**  
  A 3D vector representing the direction of the cone. This will be visualized in the Blender 3D layout as an arrow.

- **`Aperture`**  
  The aperture of the cone, in degrees. This value must be in the interval `[0, 180]`. If set to `180`, the source will be isotropic.
  
#### Time

If the recording time is enabled, the simulation will calculate and increase the age of each particle produced by this source, as well as the corresponding secondary particles. Additionally, the initial time of each particle can be configured as follows:

- **`No initialization`**  
  The initial time of all particles is set to `0`.

- **`Decay`**  
  The initial time of each produced particle is randomly sampled according to an isotope decay. The following parameters must be provided to characterize the decay:
  - **`Half life`**: The half-life, in seconds, of the isotope.
  - **`Time Window`**: A two-dimensional array specifying the minimum and maximum time, in seconds (first and second positions), to sample.

  Depending on the time window and the number of histories simulated, the total activity of the source can be calculated.
  
### PSF

  A PSF already contains all the particle states to be simulated, so it is not necessary to sample those states. Therefore, sampling methods are not required to be configured. However, the PSF filename must be provided using the **PSF** parameter. This file must be accessible when the simulation is executed. Additionally, to avoid reading the entire PSF file (which can be several GB in size), the **Maximum Energy** of all stored states must be provided in eV. This energy is used to create the tables with the physical properties of each material.

  To increase simulation efficiency, splitting and Russian roulette can be applied to the read states. The behavior of these variance reduction techniques is controlled by the following parameters:

- **`Factor`**  
  This integer value specifies how many particles a single read state will be split into. Each split state will be assigned a reduced weight ($weight / Factor$). The same factor is also used to determine the probability of skipping (killing) a read state. If the state survives, its weight will be increased accordingly. Note that these techniques are not applied to all states. Whether one or both techniques are applied depends on the **Weight Window**.

- **`Weight Window`**  
  This two-dimensional array defines a weight window to determine which variance reduction technique to apply to each state. The user must provide a **Minimum** (first position) and a **Maximum** (second position) weight value to define the window:
    - **Weight $<$ Minimum**: Russian Roulette will be applied to the read state.
    - **Minimum $\leq$ Weight $\leq$ Maximum**: No technique will be applied to the read state.
    - **Weight $>$ Maximum**: Splitting will be applied to the read state.  
  
  Finally, like the specific particle type sources, the time recording can be enabled, but the initial times are read from the PSF, not sampled.
