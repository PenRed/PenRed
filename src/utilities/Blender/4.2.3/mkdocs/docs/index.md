# PenRed Blender Plugin Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the **PenRed Blender Plugin**. This plugin integrates PenRed's simulation capabilities directly into Blender, allowing users to construct geometries, configure simulations, and export everything to the PenRed formatâ€”all within the Blender environment.

This documentation covers the plugin's functionalities in detail. However, some PenRed-specific components, such as geometry file formats, are not described extensively here. For a comprehensive understanding of these components, please refer to the official [PenRed documentation](https://github.com/PenRed/PenRed/tree/master/doc) available in the GitHub repository.

## Sections

### **Geometry Construction**
Create simulation geometries using Blender's powerful modeling tools. The plugin supports:

- **Quadric Surfaces**: Predefined quadric objects for constructing geometries.

- **Triangular Meshes**: Convert any Blender mesh into a PenRed-compatible format.

For more details, see the [Geometry Construction](geometry-construction/index.md) section.

---

### **Simulation Configuration**
Configure the entire simulation within Blender, including:
- **Particle Sources**: Define particle sources with customizable energy, direction, and time sampling.

- **Tallies**: Set up detectors and scoring regions to extract simulation data.

  - **Object Tallies**: Measure quantities within specific spatial regions.
  
  - **Detector Tallies**: Record particle interactions in detector bodies.
  
  - **World Tallies**: Capture global simulation data.
  
- **Materials**: Define material properties and assign them to geometry bodies.

For more details, see the [Simulation Configuration](simulation-configuration/index.md) section.

---

### **Export**
Export geometries and simulation configurations to the PenRed format. The plugin supports:

- **Quadric Surfaces**: Export predefined quadric objects.

- **Triangular Meshes**: Export any Blender mesh as a triangular mesh surface.

- **Configuration Files**: Save simulation settings for use in PenRed.

For more details, see the [Export](export.md) section.

## Getting Started

1. **Install the Plugin**:

    - Go to Blender's **Preferences** > **Add-ons**.
    
    - Install the plugin located in the **src>utilities>Blender** folder in the PenRed package and enable it.

2. **Explore the Plugin**:

    - Use the Blender and **Geometry Construction** tools to build your simulation geometry.
    
    - Configure your simulation using the **Simulation Configuration** options.
    
    - Export your work to the PenRed format using the **Export** functionality.

3. **Refer to the Documentation**:

    - For detailed instructions, explore the sections listed above.
    
    - For advanced PenRed features, consult the official [PenRed documentation](https://github.com/PenRed/PenRed/tree/master/doc).
